Context : John Doe, self-employed graphic designer living in a 150m² apartment in Paris. He rents the entire apartment and has designated a 20m² area as his home office for his design work.

Scenario: In this tax year, John has spent €600 on electricity bills for his home, €400 on internet and telephone services, and €300 on maintenance costs (plumbing, heating) for the entire apartment. The remaining 20m² of the apartment is used as a workspace for his graphic design business, which doesn't provide him with an office space.

Calculation:
1. Direct costs related to the home office (electricity, internet/phone services): €600 + €400 = €1000
2. Common expenses proportionate to the home office: Total common expenses (€600) x Proportion of workspace area in total apartment (20m² / 150m²) = €80
3. Total deductible expenses: €1000 + €80 = €1080

Declaration: In his tax declaration, John will fill out the following fields:
- Box 1AK for taxable income (€42,000 in this example)
- Box 1GF to declare his home office expenses (€1080)

Comparison: If John didn't have a home office and worked solely from client locations or coffee shops, he wouldn't be eligible for any deductions on these expenses under the default regime. However, by opting for the home office expense deduction, he saves €1080 in taxes this year.

Conclusion: By properly declaring his home office expenses and meeting all conditions set forth by the rule, John successfully reduced his taxable income and benefited financially.
