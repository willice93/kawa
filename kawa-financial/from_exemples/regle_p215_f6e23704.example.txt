Context : Marie, self-employed hairdresser in the city of Lyon, is retiring after 40 years of activity. She has decided to sell her hair salon to a colleague for a total amount of €700,000.

Amounts involved: The sale price of €700,000 will be added to Marie's taxable income base and subjected to social security contributions. The exempted short-term capital gain (MSFU/MSFV) from the sale is €500,000, as per Article 151 septies A of the French General Tax Code.

Declaration: In Marie's income tax declaration (1AK), she will declare the short-term capital gain of €500,000 under the specific case for exempted capital gains (MSFU/MSFV). The remaining sale price of €200,000 will be included in her total taxable income.

Comparison: If Marie had not chosen to apply the MSFU/MSFV rule, she would have paid taxes on the full €700,000 sale price. By applying this rule, she significantly reduces her overall tax bill.

Calculation: With a marginal tax rate of 30%, Marie saves €210,000 in taxes by exempting the €500,000 short-term capital gain from taxation. The remaining €200,000 will be taxed at the regular income tax rate.

Conclusion: By understanding and applying the MSFU/MSFV rule when selling her business, Marie can significantly reduce her overall tax burden upon retirement.
