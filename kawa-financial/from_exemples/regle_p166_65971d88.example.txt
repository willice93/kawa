Example Scenario:

Name: Jeanne Dupont, Self-employed Baker
Year: 2023

Background: Jeanne Dupont is a self-employed baker who runs her business, "Le Pain Quotidien", from a small shop in the heart of Paris. She has been in operation for over five years and her sales have grown steadily since she started.

Income and Expenses (2021, 2022, 2023 - all figures in Euros):
- 2021: Recettes hors taxes: 50,000€ / Dépenses: 20,000€ / Solde: 30,000€
- 2022: Recettes hors taxes: 60,000€ / Dépenses: 22,000€ / Solde: 38,000€
- 2023 (Estimated): Recettes hors taxes: 70,000€ / Dépenses (estimated): 24,000€

Tax Calculation:
1. Calculate the average of the three years' net income: (30,000€ + 38,000€ + 70,000€) / 3 = 45,000€
2. Apply the 87% abatement to the average net income: 45,000€ x 0.87 = 38,950€
3. The imposable profit for 2023 will be the recettes hors taxes of 2023 (70,000€) minus the abattement of 38,950€: 70,000€ - 38,950€ = 31,050€

Comparison:
- Without the 87% abatement, Jeanne's imposable profit for 2023 would have been 70,000€.
- With the 87% abatement, her imposable profit is significantly reduced to 31,050€.

Declaration:
On her tax declaration for 2023, Jeanne will report her recettes hors taxes for 2023 (case 1AK) and the calculated imposable profit (case 1GF). She will also confirm that her abattement meets the minimum threshold of 305€.
