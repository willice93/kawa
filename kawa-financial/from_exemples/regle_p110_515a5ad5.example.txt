Context : John Doe, self-employed sales representative based in Paris, France. He has been working with a client, Acme Corporation, for the past two years and has generated significant commissions from their partnership.

*John's annual commission earnings*: 37,500 € (total)
*Annual limit on business-related expenses as per the rule*: 765 €
*Applicable tax rate for this category of expenses*: 2%
*Relevant expense case number*: 1AK

In the course of his professional relationship with Acme Corporation, John has incurred certain expenses such as postage, business meals, and gifts worth a total of 500 € during the last fiscal year. He intends to claim these expenses as tax-deductible under the specified rule for sales representatives.

For comparison purposes, if John were to use the default regime (without this specific rule), he would not be able to deduct any business-related expenses from his commission earnings when calculating his income tax. However, with the application of the mentioned rule, he can deduct up to 765 € worth of eligible expenses from his total commission earnings, resulting in a reduced taxable income of 36,735 € (37,500 - 765 * 0.02).

In summary, John Doe, self-employed sales representative, can legitimately claim up to 765 € worth of business-related expenses incurred during the year for his relationship with Acme Corporation as tax-deductible, thus reducing his taxable income by an amount of 36,735 €.
