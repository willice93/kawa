Vimeo: Vimeo does not natively offer URLs with a video ID that display screen captures of
multiple frames. However, they do provide a single high definition still capture for every video.
This is stored in the Application Programming Interface (API) side of Vimeo, but it is easy to
obtain. As an example, consider your target is at https://vimeo.com/99199734. The unique ID
of 99199734 is assigned to that video. You can use that number to access the API vie
