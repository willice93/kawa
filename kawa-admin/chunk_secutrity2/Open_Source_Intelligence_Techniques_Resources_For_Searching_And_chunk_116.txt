Again, there are numerous free options from which to choose. I recommend
Malware Bytes for both Windows and Apple users. It is completely free and thorough. I suggest
executing, updating, and scanning at least once a week on every device that you use.

Navigate to http://www.malwarebytes.org/ and select the “Free Download” option.
Conduct a default installation.

On a weekly basis, launch the program, update the database, and conduct a full scan.
Malware Bytes will remove any issues it finds.
