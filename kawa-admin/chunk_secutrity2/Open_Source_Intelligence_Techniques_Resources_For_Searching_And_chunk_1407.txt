Spy Dialer (spydialer.com)

This service takes a new approach on identifying the user of a cellular telephone. While it offers
a typical telephone number search tool, which appears to extract data from crowd-sourced
databases, the real power lies in the voicemail retrieval. Most cellular users have an outgoing
voicemail message that identifies them by name.
