Reddit. It was onginally launched as a way for users to identify
when someone reposted a photo that had previously been posted on the website. The user could
then “down-vote” the submission and have it removed from the front page. We can use this in
investigations to locate every copy of an individual photo on Reddit. You can either provide a
link to an image or upload an image from your computer.

Real World Application: These reverse image search sites can have many uses to the
investigator.
