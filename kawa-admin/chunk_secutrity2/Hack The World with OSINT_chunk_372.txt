Most of the time to open Metasploit:

toot@kali:~# msfconsole

senerdenics to open either Metasploit you will need to start the
services

root@kali:~# service postgresq] start

root(@kali:~# service metasploit start
root(@kali:~# msfconsole

It is okay most of the time if you get an error after service

metasploit start
