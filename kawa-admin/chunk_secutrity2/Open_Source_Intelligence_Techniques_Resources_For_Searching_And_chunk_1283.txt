This was another service that surprised many privacy-conscious people. A typical entry contains
a target’s full name, current home address, current home telephone number, email addresses,
previous home addresses, additional telephone numbers, possible relatives, and age. I recently

the techniques mentioned in previous chapters, I was able to cteate a full dossier about him.
