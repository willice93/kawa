Find a Grave (findagrave.com)

While I assume that your goal is to find living targets, you should also have a resource for locating
proof of deceased individuals. I have used this website numerous times to locate the graves of
recently deceased people. While not necessarily “proof” of death, it provides a great lead toward
locating a death certificate and living family members.
