ective, I was tasked on several occasions to assist with
background checks on Police Officer applicants. Occasionally, the current address of the

of the applicant’s residence in this fashion will display all of the neighbors’ telephone numbers
and addresses. Visiting the associated profiles will identify enough information to make contact
via telephone and conduct an interview.
