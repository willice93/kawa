There are two flaws with this search. First, you may receive results from other cities named Mount
Pleasant. Second, you will likely receive too many results to analyze effectively. A search of
“geo:39.55,-111.45” will focus only on the specific GPS location of interest (Lat=39.55, Long=-
111.45). There were 238 results for this search. This is much more manageable and all of the
results will be devices in the target area.
