save it. However, this is a hassle and time consuming. You could print the page you
are viewing, but this gets difficult on some sites, such as Facebook. You could save the entire
web page to your hard drive and recreate it as needed, but this is overkill. I recommend an
automated screen capture. Lightshot Capture will do this for free. Some configuration is
necessary, but since the application is portable, you can take your changes with you. Lightshot is
available for Mac and Windows.
