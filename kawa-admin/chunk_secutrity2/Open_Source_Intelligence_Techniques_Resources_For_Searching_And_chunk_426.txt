After you log into a Google account, navigate to the website listed above. If you have never
created an engine, you will be prompted to create your first. Enter the first website that you want
to search. In my example, I will search inteltechniques.com. As you enter any website to search,
Google will automatically create another field to enter an additional website. The second website
that I will search is computercrimeinfo.com
