avigate to their internal page at
amazon.com/gp/registry/search, you can type any name or email address to search for that
targetâ€™s wish list, baby registry, or wedding registry. I have found this type of information useful

suspect that I know this information can be interesting. I once had a suspect convinced that I
had no evidence against him in reference to a child pornography investigation.
