ause color shifts. Histogram Equalization is the most
robust option. You can also set this to none. Opacity displays the opacity of the differences layer.
If you lower it you will see more of the original image. Figure 14.11 (left) displays manipulation.

Noise Analysis is basically a reverse de-noising algorithm. Rather than removing the noise it
removes the rest of the image. It is using a super simple separable median filter to isolate the
noise. It can be useful for identifying manipulations
