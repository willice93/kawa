BleachBit (bleachbit.org)

BleachBit is very similar to CCleaner, but can be a bit more aggressive. I select all available options
with the exception of “Wipe Free Space”. Choosing this would overwrite all free space on the
hard drive which is time consuming. I currently only use this program on my investigative
computers, including the Buscador virtual machine. Since I never operate these machines for
personal use, I don’t have concerns of deleting anything important.
