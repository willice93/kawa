s with Arie will likely display even
more of these “private” friends. This link could be saved as a bookmark and you can check it
often to identify anyone new that has been added to this circle of friends. Comparing a new
search to a previous screen capture of this data may also identify anyone that has been removed
from this group. An individual no longer accepted by his former friends may make a great
candidate for an interview if this group was involved in an incident you are investigating.
