ncern about this possibility. My decision to document these
techniques came down to two thoughts. First, anyone that really wants to use this information in
malicious ways will do so without this book. There is nothing in here that could not be duplicated
with some serious searching and time. The second thought is that getting this information out to
those that will use it appropriately is worth the risk of a few people using it for the wrong reasons.
