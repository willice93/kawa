ng the program will present a small icon in the taskbar..It will look similar to a purple
feather. Right-click on this and choose “options”. This will present several settings that you can
customize for your needs. You can choose which combination of keys will create a new capture
and what type of file is created. I use the PNG option and escalate the quality to 100%. You can
now click on the Lightshot icon and your screen will go dark, waiting for you to select the portion
that you want saved.
