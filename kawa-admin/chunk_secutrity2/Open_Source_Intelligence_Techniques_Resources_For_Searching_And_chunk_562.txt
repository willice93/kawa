rvers still exist in
abundance. I prefer the manual method of searching Google for FTP information. As mentioned
earlier, Google and Bing index most publicly available data on FTP servers. A custom search
string will be required in order to filter unwanted information. If I were looking for any files
including the term “confidential” in the title, I would conduct the following search on Google
and Bing.

inurl:ftp -inurl:(http | https) “confidential”

The result will include only files from ftp
