This simple add-on will identify any hyperlinks within the source code of an individual web page.
It will store the links within your operating system’s clipboard, which will allow you to paste them
into any application of your choice. While only a small utility, it can quickly turn a large project
into an easily completed task. After installing, I recommend navigating to the “options” menu
within the add-on and selecting “Copy only clickable links”. T
