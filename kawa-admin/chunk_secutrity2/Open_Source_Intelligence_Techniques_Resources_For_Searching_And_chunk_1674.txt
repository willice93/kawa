d Instagram. Vine stopped
accepting new videos, but the archives are still available. While Vine offers a reliable search option
for videos or users, you should also use Google or Bing. Use the “Site” operator on either service
to search for information of interest. The most common search will be for a real name or user
name. The following example would query any Vine videos posted by “logan paul”.

site:vine.co “logan paul”

You can also search within the text message included with each video.
