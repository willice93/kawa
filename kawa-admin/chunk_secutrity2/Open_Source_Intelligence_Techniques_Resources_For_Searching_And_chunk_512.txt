rocess. Navigating to the above website will present the same
options in a web page that are possible by typing out the operators. This will help you get familiar

Search page will allow you to specify a specific phrase for which you are searching, just like the
quotes in a search will allow. The site and filetype operators used earlier can be achieved by
entering the desired filters on this page.
