TP/S Protocols

The majority of the internet systems which Censys scans using ZMAP
utilise the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Web pages for various
purposes. Each week a general scan and host report are available,
breaking down the composition of the hosts scanned. A November

2017 host report shows just over 50% of the hosts scanned are running

HTTP or HTTPS services.
