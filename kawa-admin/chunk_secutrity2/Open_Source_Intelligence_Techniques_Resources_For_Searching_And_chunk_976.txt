PDF Profile View
You may want a quick way to collect the publicly available details from the profiles that you find.
One option is to have LinkedIn generate a PDF of the information. While on any profile, click

the three dots next to the name and choose “Save to PDF”. This will not extract any private
details, but will make data collection fast.
