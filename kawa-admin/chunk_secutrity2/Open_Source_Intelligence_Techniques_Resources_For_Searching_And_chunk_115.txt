inal note
about ClamAV, you may occasionally receive a false-positive report of a virus. Do not panic.
Research the file on the internet and identify the issues. If you receive reports of malicious files
within email, simply delete those messages. The use of ClamAV on Mac computers is more about
preventing the spread of bad files to Windows users instead of protecting your own machine.

Whether on Windows or Mac computers, protection from malicious software, otherwise known
as malware, is vital.
