Zillow (zillow.com)

This is a popular real estate information site. Entering an address will identify data such as
purchase price history, sale status, satellite view map, estimated value, and surrounding real estate
information. If the house is for sale or was recently for sale, and the home was listed on a teal
estate site, you will probably see the sale information here. If this includes interior photographs,
which most do, you can view the interior of the house.
