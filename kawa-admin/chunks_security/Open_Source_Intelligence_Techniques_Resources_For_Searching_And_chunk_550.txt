of “+Bazzell Michael | Mike | M “, without quotation marks, would return results for Michael Bazzell, Mike Bazzell, and M Bazzell. Exclude a word: Google and Bing allow you to use a hyphen (-) to exclude a word in a search. Yandex does not technically support this, but it seems to work fine. The official Yandex operator is the tilde (~). A typical search would look like “Michael Bazzell ~ Mike”, without the quotation marks. This would identify websites that contained Michael Bazzell, but not Mik
