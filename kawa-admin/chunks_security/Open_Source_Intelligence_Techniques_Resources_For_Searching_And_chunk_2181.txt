nsider searching within Twitter for any content of interest. We could navigate to Twitter, assume our suspect is chrishadnagy, and look for people mentioning him with to:chrishadnagy. Alternatively, we can ask Recon-ng to conduct this task for every user name we have collected. Typing use recon/profiles-profiles/twitterjnentions loads the module and typing run executes the process. You should immediately receive an error since you do not have a valid Twitter API key configured within Recon-ng. T
