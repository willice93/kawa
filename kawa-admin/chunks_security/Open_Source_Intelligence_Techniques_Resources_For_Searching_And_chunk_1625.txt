s is the YouTube Comment Scraper. This website allows easy use of open-source code available to extract YouTube comments from your own server. Simply provide the URL of your target video and allow the tool to process all data. The result will be a CSV spreadsheet with every comment text, including comment ID, timestamp, user name, replies, and likes. This can all be viewed within the results screen or downloaded (my preference). Figure 15.01 displays a partial collection of captured data. uwr da
