“Suspect Email” and searched a target email address. Since SpiderFoot detects the type of input and only scans appropriate services, I selected the “All” option and executed the scan. It completed in two minutes. It identified several compromised database entries (Chapter Eight), and leaked details on Pastebin (Chapter Thirteen) as well as seventeen accounts at various social networks. That is impressive for two minutes of searching. I include SpiderFoot as part of every email address investiga
