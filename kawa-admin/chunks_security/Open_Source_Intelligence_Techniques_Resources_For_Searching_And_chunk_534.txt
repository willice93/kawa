ork consisting of more than six thousand relays to conceal a userâ€™s location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult for internet activity to be traced back to the user. This also applies to a website that is hosted on the Tor network. Usually, these sites include illegal drug shops, child pornography swaps, and weapon sales. Because these sites are not hosted on publicly viewable networks, they are hard to locate and connect.
