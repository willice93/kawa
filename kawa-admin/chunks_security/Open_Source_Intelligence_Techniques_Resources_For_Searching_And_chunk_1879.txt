an offidal vehicle search, the insurance provider Progressive offers an interesting piece of information. I first learned about this technique from S.L., a member of my online OSINT forum.

If you provide the zip code and address of any target, you receive a summary of the year, make, and model of all vehicles registered at that address. You can supply any random data besides the physical address
