I have found an all-in-one Google CSE to be a bit unreliable and sporadic with results. Therefore, I created my own option, which can be seen in Figure 13.01. This search tool has three sections, all of which are explained below. The “Documents by Service” column allows entry of any terms, and the first option will populate the remaining search fields. You can then choose to execute your search for data on Google Docs, Google Drive, Microsoft Drive, Amazon AWS, Cloudfront, SlideShare, Prezi, ISS
