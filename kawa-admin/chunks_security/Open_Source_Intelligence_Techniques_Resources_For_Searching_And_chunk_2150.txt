e 21.05: A VirtualBox export menu. Genymotion is not your only option. BlueStacks (bluestacks.com), Andy (andyroid.net), and NoxPlayer (bignox.com) all offer the same basic functionality.

While the others have their own backup and export options, I find the options presented here to be more transparent and acceptable
