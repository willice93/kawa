niques.com for any archived pages, I would enter the following two queries into the search field. https://inteltechniques.com/* *.inteltechniques.com The first would look for any archived pages within the chosen domain. The second would look for any sub-domains such as mail.inteltechniques.com or ftp.inteltechniques.com. I have rarely received results from the sub-domain search through this service. The strength of Archive.is is their stance on ignoring the noarchive rule of the robots.txt file.
