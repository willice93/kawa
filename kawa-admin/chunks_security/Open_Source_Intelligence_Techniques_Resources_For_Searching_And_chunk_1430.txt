Further clicks add additional measuring points. You can also drag a point to move it, or dick a point to remove it. The total distance in both miles (mi) or kilometers (km) will appear under the search box. When finished, right-click on the map and select “Clear measurement”. GPS Coordinates: Clicking on any point will load a small window in the bottom center that identifies the exact GPS coordinates of the chosen location. If this is not visible, right-click any point and select “What*s here”.
