e. Obviously, better antennas will allow you to receive signals from a farther distance. If you find the techniques explained here successful to your investigations, then I would consider further research into superior antennas. Frequencies Most commercial receivers will monitor radio frequencies between 25 MHz and 1300 MHz. There are usually gaps in this coverage which will not affect the techniques described here. The techniques explained in this chapter will monitor public frequencies availab
