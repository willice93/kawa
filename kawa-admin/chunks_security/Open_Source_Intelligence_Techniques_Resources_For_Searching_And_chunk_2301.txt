are two main reasons I do not place screen captures within printed report text First, I believe it is better to keep the report concise and clutter-free. The client can easily view the evidence within the provided disc or drive. Second, it can be quite difficult to include an entire screen capture within an 8 V2 x 11 page. I would likely need to crop any images, which also means that I am redacting evidence. I would rather my client view the digital screen capture which displays the entire page
