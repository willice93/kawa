h. Figure 5.13 displays the analysis of three subjects. You can see that the first and second subject do not have any people in common that they follow on Twitter. This can indicate that they may not know each other in real life, or that they simply have different tastes in the people that they find interesting. However, the first and third subjects have 79 people in common that they follow on Twitter. This is a strong indication that they know each other in real life and have friends in common.
