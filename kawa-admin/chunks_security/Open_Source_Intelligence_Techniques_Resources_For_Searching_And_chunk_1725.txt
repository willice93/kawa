ecommend hourly monitoring and notification of any “tiny change”. It will now check the domain hourly and email you if anything changes. If you are watching a website that contains advertisements or any dynamic data that changes often, you can select to avoid that portion of the page. Figure 16.01 displays the monitoring option for phonelosers.org. In this example, I positioned the selection box around the blog content of the main page. I also chose the hourly inspection and Tiny Change option.
