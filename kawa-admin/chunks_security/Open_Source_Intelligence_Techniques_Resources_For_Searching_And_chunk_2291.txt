but this cover page summarizes the most damaging evidence found that contradicts his previous deposition testimony.

He was sent home on the 13, and has not returned to work since. • On June 11, 2017, Mr. Davis received an invitation through a Facebook Event from his sister, Jane Davis to attend a retirement celebration at Lake of the Ozarks
